Adjacent Sibling Selector
The adjacent sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.
Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
The following example selects all <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements:
//-->
<style>
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3. Not in a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4. Not in a div.</p>

</body>
</html>
